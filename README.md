# MD Collaboration Week team hackathon repository
:wave: hey there welcome to the repository of Team WINGING GIT :bird:

### About Us 
Our Team is made up of Joel L :bearded_person: , our kind and dedicated leader :crown:  
The wonderful crochetting Kay C :yarn: :curly_haired_woman:  
The clever Maree S :woman:  
The talented Jospeh C :basketball_man: :basketball:
The ~~wanted-to-cheat-but-Joel-and-Kay-wouldn't-let-me~~, Kristy N :fox_face: :woman:  

### Pity Plea
Unfortunately a lot of our team pulled out :sob: :sob: :sob:  
Even more unfortunately only our fearless leader Joel is capable in R :scream:	:astonished: :older_woman: :older_woman: :older_woman:   
We have had a great time, but haven't had the capabilty :technologist:, resources :money_with_wings: or time :stopwatch: to complete all tasks to the level we would like.   
Have mercy on us we're old :older_woman: :laughing:  

### The Challenge :nerd_face:

#### Theme 1
https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/Theme%201.md
#### Theme 2
**Data**
We downloaded three open datasets:
- ACT population projections
- Household Energy use
- Health Expenditure data 
- SA Housing Stress

**Code**
R code to perform data analysis and visualisation can be found [here](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/Theme%202.R)  

**Output**
[Energy Consumption by Dwelling Type](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/energy_plot.png)  
[Number of households under income stress by Tenure type and income index](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/housing_figure.png)  
[National health expenditure by type](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot1.png) [State health expenditure by type](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot2.png)
[National health expenditure over time](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot3.png)  
[Projected ACT population](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/population_plot1.png)

#### Theme 3  
A useful tool for reproducible results is R markdown. An R markdown file is a record of your analysis process, so that other analysts are able to use your the code and data to reproduce your outputs. A very useful guide to R markdown can be found [here](https://andrewbtran.github.io/NICAR/2017/reproducibility-rmarkdown/rmarkdown.html).   

We have created an example of an R markdown report, atached below as well as the code used to create it: 
[Example Rmarkdown report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/Example%20Rmarkdown%20report.html)
[Brilliant code is here!](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/Rmarkdown_example.Rmd)


Note: Reproducibility of results is a hot topic at the moment in the field of statistics and data science, and considered a non-negotiable by many high profile experts when producing high quality research. [Dr. Di Cook](http://dicook.org/), a MAC member, has a number of talks and papers on this topic.

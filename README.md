The clever Maree S :woman:
The wanted-to-cheat-but-Joel-and-Kay-wouldn't-let me, Kristy N :fox_face: :woman:

### Pity Plea
Unfortunately a lot of our team pulled out :sob: :sob: :sob:
Even more unfortunately only our fearless leader Joel is capable in R :scream:	:astonished: :older_woman: :older_woman: :older_woman:
We have had a great time, but haven't had the capabilty :technologist:, resources :money_with_wings: or time :stopwatch: to complete all tasks to the level we would like 
Have mercy on us we're old :older_woman: :laughing:

# Theme 1 - What is GitHub?

Task:
Create a resource containing information about different public GitHub initiatives created by international statistical or machine learning research organisations. Present your repository to address the following questions:How are statistical or ML research organisations using public GitHub repositories? Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations?

:wave: hey there welcome to the repository of Team WINGING GIT :bird:

### About Us 
Our Team is made up of Joel L :bearded_person: , our kind and dedicated leader :crown:

Even more unfortunately only our fearless leader Joel is capable in R :scream:	:astonished: :older_woman: :older_woman: :older_woman:
We have had a great time, but haven't had the capabilty :technologist:, resources :money_with_wings: or time :stopwatch: to complete all tasks to the level we would like 
Have mercy on us we're old :older_woman: :laughing:

In order to understand how statistical or ML research organisations are using public GitHub repositories, we conducted a search in GitHub for both of these topics. We then identified the users who have the most followers or most repositories.

## Statistics

- [Rob Hyndman](https://github.com/robjhyndman), Professor of Statistics, Monash University has the most followers (2.3k). He has 99 repositories, the top one (ranked by the highest number of stars) is his forecast package for R. :boom:

- [ONS Digital](https://github.com/ONSdigital) has the most number of repositories (1.2k). Among the popular ones are Development website for collecting and disseminating UK data for the Sustainable Development Goal global indicators, Design System for Digital Publishing and General information and standards for the ONS software engineering community of practice. :sparkles: 

- The second popular NSO user on GitHub is [Statistics Norway](https://github.com/statisticsnorway). It has 335 repositories. The top ones are uses of Java and a repository for collecting good ideas or interesting solutions staff want to share with other. :rocket:

- [Statistics Canada](https://github.com/StatCan) comes third with 174 repositories. The top popular one is Documentation for the Data Analytics as a Service Platform. :bulb: 

- We probably won't find the Australian Bureau Statistics among the top users given we are using an internal ABS Bit Bucket! :ok_hand:

## Machine Learning 

- The most popular repository is [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. :star2: 

- The most popular ML user is [Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt). They have 16k followers and are the authors of the Python Machine Learning book. :green_heart:

## Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations? 


For the guidelines we found the below :books: :

- Statistics Canada has user guide for cloud platform [link here](https://github.com/StatCan/cloud-native-platform)

- ONS has a lot of documentations however we found no guidelines for use of GitHub. Perhaps this is kept internal :laughing: 

- No guidelines are found from Statistics Norway! :innocent:

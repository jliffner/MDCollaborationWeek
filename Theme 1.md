Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations?

---

In order to understand how statistical or ML research organisations are using public GitHub repositories, we conducted a search in GitHub for both of these topics. We then identified the users who have the most followers or most repositories.

## Statistics

- [Rob Hyndman](https://github.com/robjhyndman), Professor of Statistics, Monash University has the most followers (2.3k). He has 99 repositories, the top one (ranked by the highest number of stars0 is his forecast package for R.

- [ONS Digital](https://github.com/ONSdigital) has the most number of repositories (1.2k). Among the popular ones are Development website for collecting and disseminating UK data for the Sustainable Development Goal global indicators, Design System for Digital Publishing and General information and standards for the ONS software engineering community of practice.

- The second popular NSO user on GitHub is [Statistics Norway](https://github.com/statisticsnorway). It has 335 repositories. The top ones are uses of Java and a repository for collecting good ideas or interesting solutions staff want to share with other.

- [Statistics Canada](https://github.com/StatCan) comes third with 174 repositories. The top popular one is Documentation for the Data Analytics as a Service Platform.

- We are *100%* sure that we can't find the Australian Bureau Statistics among the top users :tear: given we are using an internal ABS Bit Bucket! 

## Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations? 


For the guidelines we found the below:

- Statistics Canada has user guide for cloud platform [link here](https://github.com/StatCan/cloud-native-platform)

- ONS has a lot of documentations however we found non on guidelines for use of GitHub. Perhaps this is kept internal :laughing: 

- No guidelines are found from Statistics Norway!

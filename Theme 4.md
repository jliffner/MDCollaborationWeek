Hello :zap: Statistical :zap: friends of the interwebs, here we are going to chat about various kinds of basic statistical data analysis. 
Statistical data analysis covers an entire 	:star: galaxy :star: of methods and concepts. We are going to focus on what should be the first step of any task with data, **Getting to know your data!**  Team Winging Git :bird: highly reccomends  YouTube channels like [2Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) for more detailed data analytics and machine learning tools. 

So lets dive in

### :bellhop_bell: Getting to know your data 
Exploratory data analysis is an undervalued tool by most analysts, it can reveal both error and pattern, alert the analyst to when data need to undergo cleaning prior to analysis (:mega: shout out to tidyr), reveal biases, underlying correlations, and especially help the analyst decide the most appropriate analytical method to choose for more in depth analysis. 
>For example, without understanding underlying patterns in data such as linearity and distributions, the analyst could chose a correlation method unsuitable to draw inference from the data

### :balloon: Examples from Theme 2
In Theme 2 of this challenge, Team Winging Git :bird: performed a number of simple data analysis and visualisations to draw inference and conclusion from open data sets. In this section we will present the results, discuss how the example helps us draw inference from the data and perhaps suggest some other ways we could present the data. 

#### :mushroom: I want to learn about Health Expenditure data!
Below national health expenditure data is graphed using the ggplot :fire:. From this data we can make inferences about Government and Non-government funding of different health expenditure products.   

Plot 1 :cat:
![graph1](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot1.png)
Our brains :brain: are highly skilled in drawing stories from visual aids, much more so than tables of numbers. You can see in this plot the use of high contrast enables the readers to make quick conclusions about spending on health. 
  
  
Plot 2 	:dog:
![graph2](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot2.png)
In this plot we now break the data down by state to draw conclusions about health expenditure between jurisdictions, however now rather than comparing 2 categories we are comparing 8 :exploding_head: The result is a bit harder for the analyst to take in. 
>Can you think of a different type of visualisation or data presentation tool that might work better for this data?

  _This is the same data as Plot 2 above but with a much nicer visualisation for your brain :brain: to draw information on. Its also very very pretty which always get bonus points_ :rainbow: :unicorn:

Plot 3 :monkey:
![graph3](https://github.com/jliffner/MDCollaborationWeek/blob/main/health_expenditure_plot3.png)
A tool :wrench: which should be in every analyst's toolkit are line graphs. These are particularly insightful for a time series, as presented above. This particular line graph highlights that public hospital expenditure has doubled over the reference period where other expenditure groups have barely increased.
>How would you make this graph more digestible for a reader? 
#### :mushroom: Give it a crack! :firecracker:  
Now is your turn to try and draw some basic conclusions from the line graph below. See if you can answer the following questions
1. How much is the population projected to grow over the next 20 years?
2. What can you tell about ACT mortality and birth rates by looking at the 0-14 and 65+ lines over the next 40 years?
3. Why does the 15-64 age group have a much higher gradient than the other lines?
